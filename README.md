# Motor-Bearing-Monitoring-NN
Electric motor bearing monitoring based on sound utilizing neural networks.

This code detects faulty bearing of an electric motor by the sound it makes. Detecting faults in industrial environment is important because failure in some critical component might can cause the entire plant to halt. Production losses of downtime can be easily millions of euros.

Video about laboratory setting of normal and faulty motor. Detecting obvious fault by listening is easy. See if you can hear which motor is healty and which one is faulty.
